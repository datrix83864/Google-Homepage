This is for the first project on The Odin Project.
THe goal is to recreate an existing webpage. My goal is to recreate the google website (non-functional).
In general I was able to succeed enough to a point that I felt comfortable moving on. While there are aspects that I found difficult such as aligning content properly I was able to get some of the basic idea out.
The search bar doesn't do anything, neither do the links.
